      Saïd Business School (Oxford Saïd or SBS) is the business school of the
      University of Oxford, named after its founding benefactor Wafic Saïd. The
      School is a provider of management education and is consistently ranked as
      one of the world's top business schools. Oxford School of Management
      Studies was rebranded as Saïd Business School in 1996 after a donation of
      £20 million was accepted from Saïd. New premises were built on Park End
      Street and opened in 2001. The Thatcher Business Education Centre was
      opened on the same site in 2012 after a further donation from Saïd. The
      School has another centre at Egrove Park, on the former site of Templeton
      College, and in 2019 acquired an old power station in Osney to convert
      into a Global Leadership Centre. Saïd Business School is the University of
      Oxford's department for graduate students in business, management and
      finance. Undergraduates are also taught as part of the Economics and
      Management course together with the Economics Department.

      <div class="belowmain">
        A site for the new premises was found on Park End Street opposite Oxford
        railway station on what was formerly the Oxford Rewley Road railway
        station. The building was designed by Edward Jones and Sir Jeremy Dixon.
        The opening on 5 November 2001 was accompanied by a demonstration by
        students concerned about the controversial nature of Wafic Saïd's
        donation. Saïd was linked with the UK's signing of the Al-Yamamah arms
        deal. In 2007 Templeton College merged with Green College to form Green
        Templeton College, based on the existing Green College site. The former
        Templeton site at Egrove Park then became the Saïd Business School
        Executive Education Centre. In 2012 the Thatcher Business Education
        Centre, financed by a donation from Saïd, was opened on the Park End
        Street site. Saïd donated a further £15 million in 2019 to finance the
        conversion of the old Osney power station into a Global Leadership
        Centre.

          Egrove Park is located in a stunning setting and is based just 2 miles
          (a 10-minute drive away) from the city centre. Built in 1969, it
          retains some very quirky features reminiscent of 1960s architecture.
          Its proximity to the A34, the Oxford ring road and the M40 allow easy
          access to nearby places of interest such as Blenheim Palace and for
          the business traveler, Oxford science and business parks are only
          minutes away.
