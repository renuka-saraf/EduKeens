        John Outram converted the listed ward blocks and arcades of the old
        hospital building, and rebuilt the central block into a space that now
        contains a library, common room, seminar and teaching rooms, floating
        staircases and balconies, break-out boxes and the main hall. He also
        added three new buildings: The Ark, containing rooms for faculty,
        research graduates, and administrative staff. The Castle, containing two
        key lecture theatres and MBA teaching spaces and room. The Gallery, an
        80 feet (24.5m) high space containing seminar rooms, multi-level
        circulation routes, and part of the hall.

          There are a range of scholarships available to Cambridge MBA students,
          from Cambridge Judge Business School bursaries and University of
          Cambridge and College scholarships, to externally funded awards. If
          you require financial assistance with fees through scholarships, it’s
          essential to apply for the Cambridge MBA early. Please note that many
          University scholarships’ application deadlines are as early as October
          for many applicants. All scholarships and bursaries are awarded before
          the start of the academic year. There are no funds that can be awarded
          after the School year has started, and candidates should not make
          financial plans assuming that they will receive funds after they have
          started the programme.

          surrounded by Colleges, and is a few minutes’ walk from King’s College
          Chapel and the River Cam. This is a unique and beautiful city in which
          to spend 12 months studying for your MBA. It is a small town, easy to
          cycle across, with plenty of green space and beautiful historic
          architecture. Our students enjoy the setting as an inspiring backdrop
          for study and collaboration. But Cambridge is only 45 minutes from
          London by train, so you will also feel connected to the capital and
          the opportunities for work and leisure there.

          Student accommodation is granted by College, but is not guaranteed.
          You can expect different facilities in different Colleges. Some may
          offer more modern facilities including en-suite bathrooms, others may
          not. It is important to note that not all College accommodation is
          situated within the main College grounds. Many graduates live in
          College houses in and around the easily accessible city centre. In
          some cases, Colleges may be unable to offer accommodation. Demand
          often outstrips supply, especially for married or family housing. You
          may also prefer to rent your own flat or house. The University
          Accommodation Service is at your disposal, along with many rental
          agencies in the city.
