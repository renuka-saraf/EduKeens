        Rotman is located in the heart of the University of Toronto's downtown
        St. George Campus. There are several noteworthy features of the building
        (completed in 1995) that houses the school: The Fleck Atrium is a large
        area on the main (ground) floor which is often used for special events,
        receptions, and public lectures. It occupies the central area of the
        building, with an open-air concept that allows individuals on the 2nd
        and 3rd floors of the building to observe from above. The vaulted
        ceiling of the atrium is made from glass, creating a brightness
        throughout the interior space. The Business Information Centre is the
        school's library, and is a branch of the University of Toronto's library
        system. The Financial Research and Trading Lab is a state-of-the-art
        facility allowing students access to a wide range of financial analysis
        software packages and data sets. A variety of business competitions are
        held in the lab throughout the year. In particular the Rotman
        International Trading Competition (RITC) is an annual trading
        competition featuring universities from around the world.

          $4 million expansion of the building, completed in 2005, added about a
          dozen new faculty/administrative offices and some meeting rooms to
          each of the 4th and 5th floors of the building. The newly created
          space also houses the Marcel Desautels Centre for Integrative
          Thinking. To accommodate dramatic growth of the program, the school
          expanded into a new $91.8-million building designed by KPMB Architects
          which opened in September 2012. The new building, adjacent to and
          fully integrated with the existing structure, nearly doubles the size
          of the facilities to provide more space for research and education.
