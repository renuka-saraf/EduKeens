		<h2 class="subheading1" style="color:black">History of the Imperial College London
		</h2>
		<div id="history" class="main"><strong>Imperial College London </strong>,(legally Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine) is a public research university in London. The university grew out of Prince Albert's vision for a cultural area in South Kensington, including the Royal Albert Hall, Victoria & Albert Museum, Natural History Museum, and several Royal Colleges. In 1907, King Edward VII granted Royal Charter to establish the university, unifying the Royal College of Science, Royal School of Mines, and City and Guilds of London Institute. In 1988, the Imperial College School of Medicine was formed by merging with St Mary's Hospital Medical School. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Imperial College Business School.</div>

    							<br>Computer science is the study of computers and computing as well as their theoretical and practical applications. Computer science applies the principles of mathematics, engineering, and logic to a plethora of functions, including algorithm formulation, software and hardware development, and artificial intelligence.
    							It's not only about learning the things we need to know; but also how to think. It's an amazing degree - it's versatile, practical and extremely engaging. I love the enthusiasm of the lecturers and the way they pass it on to students. The best part of the Computer Science course is the practicals.Oxford has one of the longest-established Computer Science departments in the country. Today it is home to a community of world-class research and teaching. ... To be a successful Computer Science student, you will need a curiosity about how things work, and the ability to use mathematics to solve problems creatively.<br>The Masters in Advanced Computer Science has been designed to teach a range of advanced topics to graduates of computer science and other mathematical disciplines. The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.
