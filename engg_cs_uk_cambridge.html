		<h2 class="subheading1" style="color:black">History of the University of Cambridge
		</h2>
		<div id="history" class="main"><strong>The University of Cambridge</strong>,is a collegiate research university in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Founded in 1209 and granted a royal charter by Henry III in 1231, Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's fourth-oldest surviving university. The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with the townspeople. The two English ancient universities share many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge.ge.Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties and other institutions organised into six schools. </div>

		<h4 id="campus" class="subheading2" style="color:black;">University of Campbridge Campus</h4>
		<div class="belowmain">The university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge, with the students taking up a significant proportion (nearly 20%) of the town's population and heavily affecting the age structure. Most of the older colleges are situated nearby the city centre and river Cam, along which it is traditional to punt to appreciate the buildings and surroundings.
		Examples of notable buildings include King's College Chapel, the history faculty building designed by James Stirling; and the Cripps Building at St John's College. The brickwork of several of the colleges is also notable: Queens' College contains "some of the earliest patterned brickwork in the country" and the brick walls of St John's College provide examples of English bond, Flemish bond and Running bond.
		<ul id="rankings" style="list-style-type: square;text-align:left; font-size:30px; margin-top: 30px; margin-left:350px"><strong style="color:black;">Sites in the Campus</strong>
			<li>Addenbrooke's</li>
			<li>Downing Site</li>
			<li>Madingley/Girton</li>
			<li>New Museums Site</li>
			<li>Old Addenbroke's</li>
			<li>Old Schools</li>
			<li>Silver Street/Mill Lane</li>
			<li>Sidgwick Site</li>
			<li>West Cambridge</li>
			<li>North West Cambridge Development</li>
		</ul><br><br>
		The university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital where students in medicine undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree,[57] while the West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host a new sports development. In addition, the Judge Business School, situated on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses since 1990 and is consistently ranked within the top 20 business schools globally by the Financial Times.
		Given that the sites are in relative close proximity to each other and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle: a fifth of the journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits, except under special circumstances

				<h4 style="margin-top:100px;font-size: 34px;color:black;">Colleges</h4>The colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, founded as integral parts of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. Their importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees, but undergraduates receive their supervisions—small-group teaching sessions, often with just one student—within the colleges (though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in the areas concerned). Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, who are also members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university regulations.<br><br>
				Cambridge has 31 colleges, of which two, Murray Edwards and Newnham, admit women only. The other colleges are mixed, though most were originally all-male. Darwin was the first college to admit both men and women, while Churchill, Clare, and King's were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates, in 1972. Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women, in 1988. Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, St Edmund's and Wolfson admit only mature (i.e. 21 years or older on date of matriculation) students, encompassing both undergraduate and graduate students. Lucy Cavendish, which was previously a women-only mature college, announced that they would admit men and women from the age of 18 from 2021 onwards. All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students with no age restrictions..<br><br>Colleges are not required to admit students in all subjects, with some colleges choosing not to offer subjects such as architecture, history of art or theology, but most offer close to the complete range. Some colleges maintain a bias towards certain subjects, for example with Churchill leaning towards the sciences and engineering, while others such as St Catharine's aim for a balanced intake. Others maintain much more informal reputations, such as for the students of King's to hold left-wing political views, or Robinson's and Churchill's attempts to minimise their environmental impact.
				Costs to students (accommodation and food prices) vary considerably from college to college. Similarly, college expenditure on student education also varies widely between individual colleges.

    							At Oxford it's not only about learning the things we need to know; but also how to think. It's an amazing degree - it's versatile, practical and extremely engaging. I love the enthusiasm of the lecturers and the way they pass it on to students. The best part of the Computer Science course is the practicals.Oxford has one of the longest-established Computer Science departments in the country. Today it is home to a community of world-class research and teaching. ... To be a successful Computer Science student, you will need a curiosity about how things work, and the ability to use mathematics to solve problems creatively.<br>The Masters in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge has been designed to teach a range of advanced topics to graduates of computer science and other mathematical disciplines. The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.
